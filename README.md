### 2. Safety First

**WARNING: Read all safety warnings and instructions before use.** Failure to follow all instructions may result in electric shock, fire, and/or serious injury.

**Personal Safety**
* **Always wear eye protection.** Protective goggles must comply with ANSI Z87.1 (USA), EN 166 (Europe), or AS/NZS 1336 (Australia/New Zealand). In Australia/New Zealand, you are legally required to wear a face shield.
* **Dress properly.** Do not wear loose clothing, jewellery, or cloth work gloves which may get entangled. Keep hair and clothing away from moving parts.
* **Wear protective footwear.** Always wear substantial, non-slip footwear. Do not operate the machine barefoot or in open sandals.
* **Stay alert.** Do not use the tool while tired or under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication.

**Work Area Safety**
* **Inspect the area before use.** Remove all stones, sticks, wires, bones, and other foreign objects from the work area. Thrown objects can cause severe injury.
* **Check for hidden objects.** Watch for holes, ruts, bumps, or other hidden objects. Tall grass can hide obstacles.
* **Keep bystanders away.** Keep children, pets, and bystanders at least 15m away from the machine during operation.

**Machine & Battery Safety**
* **Disconnect the battery before maintenance.** Always ensure the machine is off and the battery is removed before cleaning, making adjustments, or storing the machine.
* **Keep hands and feet away from blades.** The scarifier blades continue to rotate for a few seconds after the machine is switched off.
* **Use only genuine Makita batteries and chargers.** Use of any other batteries may cause injury and/or fire.
* **Do not expose the battery to fire or high temperatures.** Temperatures above 130°C may cause an explosion.
* **Handle batteries carefully.** When not in use, keep the battery pack away from metal objects like paper clips, coins, or keys that could make a connection between terminals.
