### 5. Operation Guide

**Correct Handling**
* **Always wear the shoulder harness.** Adjust it to a comfortable position before you begin.
* **Position the tool on your right-hand side.** This allows for maximum control.
* **Hold the tool firmly with both hands.**
* **Swing the tool evenly in a half-circle**, like using a scythe. The most effective cutting is done on the side of the nylon head, not the tip.
