* **Dress properly.** Do not wear loose clothing or jewellery. Keep your hair and clothing away from moving parts.
* **Wear protective footwear.** Always wear non-slip and protective footwear when operating the lawnmower.
* **Stay alert.** Do not use the mower while you are tired or under the influence of drugs, alcohol or medication.

**Work Area Safety**
* **Inspect the area before use.** Thoroughly inspect the area where the mower will be used and remove all stones, sticks, wires, bones, and other foreign objects.
* **Keep bystanders away.** The distance between the tool and bystanders must be at least 15 m. Stop the mower if anyone enters the area.
* **Check for hidden objects.** Watch for holes, ruts, bumps, or rocks. Tall grass can hide obstacles.

**Machine & Battery Safety**
* **Disconnect the battery before maintenance.** Always ensure the mower is off and the battery is removed before cleaning, making adjustments, or storing the machine.
* **Keep hands and feet away from blades.** The mower blades continue to rotate for a few seconds after the motor is switched off.
* **Use only genuine Makita batteries and chargers.** Use of any other batteries may cause injury and/or fire.
* **Handle batteries carefully.** When not in use, keep the battery pack away from metal objects like paper clips, coins, or keys that could make a connection between terminals.
